# Synopsis

My file is a simple inventory manager. It is useful for stores that don't really have access to great software for their business.

# Code Example

With my code you will input a part number. The code will then take that number display you the price of the item, and subtract the total of that part in the inventory.

# Motivation

I made this code because I work in a store with a bad ordering system and I believe this would help a lot.

# Contributors

I welcome any collaboration on this project. I wrote the code myself, but it is rough. If anyone can improve upon it I welcome that.
